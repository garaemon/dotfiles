# ShellCheck configuration for zsh dotfiles
# zsh is not fully supported by ShellCheck, so we suppress
# false positives caused by zsh-specific syntax.

# Parse errors from zsh-specific syntax
# SC1009: Mentioned syntax error was in this function (cascading from zsh syntax)
# SC1036: '(' invalid here (zsh local function syntax)
# SC1056: Expected '}' (cascading from zsh syntax)
# SC1072: Missing '}' (cascading from zsh syntax)
# SC1073: Couldn't parse brace group (cascading from zsh syntax)
# SC1035: Missing space after ! (zsh &! for disown)
# SC1071: ShellCheck only supports sh/bash scripts
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# SC1091: Not following sourced files

# Zsh-specific variable and expansion behavior
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (zsh special variables like fpath, HISTFILE)
# SC2038: Use find -print0 | xargs -0 (too noisy for these scripts)
# SC2046: Quote to prevent word splitting (too noisy for zsh)
# SC2068: Double quote array expansions (zsh handles $@ differently)
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing (too noisy for zsh)
# SC2124: Assigning array to string (valid in zsh)
# SC2128: Expanding array without index (valid in zsh)
# SC2145: Argument mixes string and array (valid in zsh)
# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned (zsh special variables)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (stylistic, too noisy)
# SC2181: Check exit code directly (stylistic)
# SC2139: Expands when defined not used (intentional in zsh aliases)
# SC2206: Quote to prevent word splitting in array assignments
# SC2296: Parameter expansion with zsh flags like ${(f)...}
# SC2298: ${${x}} nested expansion (valid in zsh)
# SC2299: Parameter expansion in ${${...}} (zsh nested expansion)

# Not POSIX warnings (expected in zsh)
# SC3010: [[ ]] is not POSIX
# SC3030: Array syntax is not POSIX
# SC3037: echo flags not POSIX
# SC3039: [[ pattern matching not POSIX
# SC3040: setopt/unsetopt not POSIX
# SC3043: 'local' is not POSIX
# SC3044: 'typeset' is not POSIX
# SC3045: zsh builtins not in POSIX
# SC3054: Array references not POSIX
# SC3057: String indexing not POSIX

# Bash-specific warnings not applicable to zsh
# SC2168: 'local' only valid in functions (zsh allows top-level local)
# SC2317: Command unreachable (zsh hooks like precmd are invoked indirectly)
